Preliminaries: Installing libraries and downloading data
Before building the code, you need to install the required libraries.

The libraries needed for the code are:

requests - The library used for accessing the information from the URL.

bs4 - The library containing the BeautifulSoup function used for webscraping.

pandas - The library used for processing the extracted data, storing it in required formats, and communicating with the databases.

sqlite3 - The library required to create a database server connection.

numpy - The library required for the mathematical rounding operations.

datetime - The library containing the function datetime used for extracting the timestamp for logging purposes.

Install the required libraries from the terminal window. The command syntax is:

python3.11 -m pip install <library_name>

Also, download the required exchange rate file using the terminal command:

wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-Coursera/labs/v2/exchange_rate.csv
